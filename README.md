# Isometric-Farm-Demo

# Introduction
This project is a simple demo for an isometric farm game. 

Python and it's Pygame module are used for creating the game.

# Instructions
The camera is moved using the arrow keys. The return key changes the currently selected tile into a 'dirt' tile.

# Future Goals
- Separate background tiles from sprites that exist above it.
- Implement crop tiles that randomly incremently grow.
- Create a monetary system and a display for the system.

# Artwork
All artwork is created by me unless otherwise stated.
